Hangman Game
This Hangman game written in Python allows players to guess the names of BTS and Blackpink members. The game starts by randomly choosing a name from the given list of artists and provides a series of underscores representing the letters in the name. The player has to guess the letters of the artist's name within a limited number of attempts, or else, they lose the game.

How to Play:
Run the Python script.
Enter your name when prompted.
Guess a letter that you think might be in the artist's name.
Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the name or exhaust all your attempts.
